# Project Features

I built a donation campaign website with react & react router. In my website , I have some
exciting features:

- **Donation Details:** Users can easily check out the donation details by clicking the cards. The website simplifies the process of seeing the detils of the donation and provides an intuitive interface for managing their donations. Users can donate by clicking the donate button which shows the donation amount.

- **Donated Fund Overview:** The website offers users the ability to view the donated funds in the Donation Page. It simplifies the process of tracking and managing the Donated funds & make it easier to keep onself up to date with their contribution.

- **Donation Statistics:** The website displays a Piechart in Statistics page. It shows the percentage between Total donation and users given donation. This feature helps users to see that his contribution counts.

- **Interactive User Interface:** The website provides an interactive and visually appealing user interface. Users can view donation funds in many ways, While the website keeps the App state and make seamless transition from one page to another.
